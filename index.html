      To reproduce:<br />
      Look at your console.<br />
      Drop all 16 files from
      <a
        href="https://github.com/Lenni009/ff-worker-issue/tree/main/public/testImages"
        target="_blank"
        >public/testImages</a
      >
      here.<br />
      It will log out how many files have been compressed.<br />
      If the counter reaches 16, that means everything worked.<br />
      In Chrome, this counter reaches 16.<br />
      In Firefox, it throws errors along the way, and the files with an error do
      not get compressed.<br />
      The error happens in the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/Lenni009/ff-worker-issue/blob/main/src/lib/worker.ts"
        target="_blank"
        >src/lib/worker.ts</a
      >
      file (marked by comment)
    </p>
    <input id="file-upload" type="file" multiple />
  </body>
